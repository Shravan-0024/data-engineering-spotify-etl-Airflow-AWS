# data-engineering-spotify-etl-Airflow-AWS
Built an end-to-end data pipeline to fetch Spotify's Top 50 Indian songs daily using Apache Airflow. Implemented two approaches: one using Airflow(using Airflow Docker Compose) for the entire ETL process with all Python code written directly in DAG tasks, and another using Airflow purely for orchestration by triggering AWS Lambda functions and Glue jobs.
